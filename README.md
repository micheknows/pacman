# Pacmen Exercise

This project uses JavaScript to generate Pacman images on the screen and animate them moving around. 

## Description

This simple app allows users to click a button to generate new Pacman images on the screen at random positions. It uses JavaScript to create the Pacman objects with random position and velocity properties. When the "Start Game" button is clicked, the Pacmen bounce around the screen interacting with the edges to change direction. Their position is updated on each animation frame to create the movement effect.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Click the "Add PacMan" button to create new Pacmen, and click the "Start Game" button to animate them.  

## Roadmap

Future improvements for this project include:

- Adding collision detection between individual Pacmen
- Increasing variety of Pacman images/animations  
- Adding a score that increases when Pacmen collide
- Allowing user input to control a Pacman character
